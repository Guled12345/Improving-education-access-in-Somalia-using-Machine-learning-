# Improving Education Access in Somalia Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a predictive machine learning model that identifies students in Somalia at risk of dropping out or receiving insufficient education due to socioeconomic or geographical factors.

## Dataset
A synthetic dataset has been created to mimic real-world challenges in the Somali education system, including factors such as socioeconomic status, geographic region, family size, resource availability, and final grades.

## Models
1. Simple neural network model (without optimization).
2. Optimized neural network model (using regularization, dropout, and learning rate scheduling).

## Results
The optimized model showed better performance in classifying students at risk of dropping out compared to the simple model by applying regularization and dropout techniques.

## Instructions for Running the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `notebook.ipynb` for code and analysis.
4. Load the saved models from the `saved_models/` directory.

## Key Findings
Optimizing the neural network model with regularization, dropout, and learning rate scheduling improved classification accuracy and reduced overfitting.
